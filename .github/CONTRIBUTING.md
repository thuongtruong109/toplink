# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing! We love and encourage pull requests from everyone.

### Abstract

Before submitting major changes, here are a few guidelines to follow:

#### 1. Check for existing issues or PRs

Before starting, please check the [open issues][issues] and [pull requests][prs] for existing discussions. If you don't find an issue or PR, please open a new issue to discuss the new feature or enhancement.

#### 2. Open an issue

If you plan to add a new feature or enhancement, please open an issue first to discuss it. This will help us to understand your needs and provide feedback.

#### 3. Branching

Always add features or fixes in a new branch, and never in `main`. This will help us to review and test your changes before merging them into the main codebase.

#### 4. Write tests

We have a test suite for the project, and we expect you to write tests for your changes. Make sure the test suite passes locally and on CI.

#### 5. Run pre-commit checks

Before submitting your changes, ensure your changes pass all checks. This will run the linter, tests, and other checks.

#### 6. Update the documentation

Make sure to update the documentation to reflect your changes. This includes the README, and any other relevant documentation.

#### 7. Open a pull request
